# X-NUCLEO-IHM05A1
The X-NUCLEO-IHM05A1 is a bipolar stepper motor driver expansion board based on the L6208 driver for bipolar stepper motors. It provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for driving bipolar stepper motors in STM32 Nucleo projects. The X-NUCLEO-IHM05A1 is compatible with the Arduino UNO R3 connector, and supports the addition of other STM32 expansion boards with a single STM32 Nucleo board. The user can also mount the ST Morpho connector.

# Examples 
X_NUCLEO_IHM05A1_HelloWorld: This application provides a simple example of usage of the X-NUCLEO-IHM05A1 bipolar stepper motor driver expansion board based on the L6208 driver for bipolar stepper motors. It shows how to to drive a two phase bipolar stepper motor including: a dual DMOS full bridge, the constant off time PWM current controller that performs the chopping regulation and the phase sequence generator, that generates the stepping sequence.
